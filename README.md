# I don't want to run a server!

I started a little hosting server at [liquilt.org](http://liquilt.org) (be gentle it runs on a Raspberry Pi 4)

# How to get started

I assume you have Python and Pip installed

- Install the Liquilt CLI to convert your quilt to the required format:
    - `pip install liquilt`

- Run the command to convert your quilt to the required format (you can use test_quilt.png if you wish, it is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0))

- Now you can use the component as shown in the example folder! (Note, it needs to be hosted on a (local) static file server)
    - You can also use the [Liquilt uploader](https://emeraldodin.com/liquilt_uploader) to upload your result if you don't want to host a page.


# To do
